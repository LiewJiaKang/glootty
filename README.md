## 📘 What is GLOOTT?

**GLOOTT** stands for **Generative Learning Object Organizer and Thinking Task** — a pedagogically enriched design framework developed to improve **higher-order thinking skills (HOTS)**.

It consists of two pillars:

### 🧠 Generative Learning Object Organizer (GLOO)
A structured repository for reusable, learner-centered content objects that form the foundation of active learning environments.

### 🧠 Thinking Tasks (TT)
Critical engagement tasks that guide users through **analysis**, **synthesis**, and **evaluation** — the core of reflective learning.

> GLOOTT blends content with cognition to empower learners to think, apply, and grow.
